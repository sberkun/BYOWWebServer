# BYOWWebServer

I couldn't figure out how to make a web client for BYOWServer, so I made this instead.

Performance is quite bad, but its marginally playable



## Usage

Copy BYOWWebServer.java into the Networking directory, then change Engine.java to use BYOWWebServer instead of BYOWServer.

Run the game as you would with BYOWServer, and then go to [TODO: fill in] to play the game.
